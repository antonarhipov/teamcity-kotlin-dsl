Besides storing settings in version control in XML format, TeamCity also allows storing the settings in the DSL (based on the Kotlin language).

Using the version control-stored DSL enables you to define settings programmatically. Since Kotlin is statically typed, you automatically receive the auto-completion feature in IDE which makes the discovery of available API options a much simpler task.
